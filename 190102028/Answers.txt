Maximum varience ratio is obtained form the case 3 vs 8
This case is very differnet from the features obtained from plotting 
	Plotting Result = feature 1 and 2
	Variance Ratio = feature 3 and 8

-Also it can be clearly viewed from the graphs of 1 vs 2 and 3 vs 8 that 1 vs 2 does a better job of classifying the data 
in its particular label as there is clear boundry btw label 1 and 2 

-Whereas in 3 vs 8 both the labels are overlapping each other.

- 3 vs 8 graph show a curve which can be easily fitted in comparison to the scattered values. Hence a huge value 
of variance ratio

-This shows that PCA shouldn't be used for selecting features for a classification problem. As PCA dosent involve the input of labels.
 
-Also the boundry shown by label 1 and 2 isn't linear and PCA shows issues with Non Linear classification problems
