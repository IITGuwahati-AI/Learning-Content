By observing all the figures, we deduce that the best boundary can be drawn to separate the red and blue points if we classify them based on features 1 & 2.
Moreover, using PCA we first check the contributions to total variance of each component(feature) and then we pick the 2 features whose explained variance ratios are the 2 highest ones to classify the dataset.
