# Instructions

(Google for terms that you can't understand)

1. Import the dataset into a matrix using **numpy**. The dataset is space delimited with first column as labels and rest 10 as features.

2. Plot all features vs each other (2 at a time) using **matplotlib** - `red` for label `1` and `blue` for label `2`, clearly denote the axes and the title of the plot along with proper markings (what does each axis represent) on the axes.

3. Find the **two features** which can classify the **two labels** perfectly.

4. *Optional* (with *bonus* points, see below): Use scikit-learn to apply [Principal Component Analysis(PCA)](http://files.isec.pt/DOCUMENTOS/SERVICOS/BIBLIO/Documentos%20de%20acesso%20remoto/Principal%20components%20analysis.pdf), find the best two features and check if they are the same as the ones you observed. 

# Point System

- 10 points for completing the 1st 3 instructions each (Total points = 30).
- The bonus task weighs *50 points*.
- Independent self projects will be given points based on the discussion in the group.
- The toppers of the *leaderboard* will be given prizes.

2. Upload the code and results(graphs/plots/best feature with explantion) in a folder with the format <name_roll number> in your own forked repo and make a pull request to this parent repository.

3. After **Wednesday night** no request will be entertained.

4. For any serious doubt regarding code on data set create an issue in this very repository. Please do not comment on the FB post with your doubts.
