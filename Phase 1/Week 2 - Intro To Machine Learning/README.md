## Session 2: Intro to Machine Learning

From this week onwards, we begin with our course work. So, we start off with two courses:
- [CS229][1] from Stanford University
- Siraj Raval's [Math of Intelligence][2]

# To-Do before next session:

1. Complete Lectures 1 through 5 from the [CS229 course][1]. Try making notes for every video you watch. It'll be helpful down the lane.
2. Complete videos till week 2 of Siraj Raval's [Math of Intelligence][2] (total 4 videos).
3. Complete the Assignment given in the `assignment` folder.
4. Study [this][3] paper. Be prepared with a short summary or presentation of the paper for the next session. We will pe awarding 10 points for the Summary submission. Also, during the next session, we'll be randomly picking up people and asking them to present. This is going to contribute towards your writing, speaking and presentation skills, as mentioned in our introductory lecture.

# Optional for Bonus Points:

Implement all that you have learned in the Siraj Raval Video Series. You can find each coding challenge in the description of the respective videos. Learning the intricacies of implementation is equally important too. The videos provide a Jupyter Notebook that Siraj has followed. The minimum you can do is to simply replicate the notebook by re-writing every single line of code. There's no way for us to check whether you have just renamed that notebook and submitted (and we don't want to know either). It is totally for your learning and writing each and every line of code yourself, would go a long way in strengthening your understanding. Please don't treat this as we treat the course assignments given in our college.
