Part 1 : Importing data and forming matrix and plots : Done

Part 2 : Most classified plot ? It was between Feature 1 and Feature 2 because of least overlapping between both feature's data points

The graphs are named as XY.png where X stands for Feature No. on X axis and Y stands for Feature No of Y axis.

Bonus Part : Still trying to understand. If done, I will create another pull request.
