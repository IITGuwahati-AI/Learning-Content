def lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, lambda_):
    """
    Computes the cost of using theta as the parameter for regularized
    logistic regression and the gradient of the cost w.r.t. to the parameters.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    theta : array_like
        Logistic regression parameters. A vector with shape (n, ). n is 
        the number of features including any intercept.  
    
    X : array_like
        The data set with shape (m x n). m is the number of examples, and
        n is the number of features (including intercept).
    
    y : array_like
        The data labels. A vector with shape (m, ).
    
    lambda_ : float
        The regularization parameter. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    J : float
        The computed value for the regularized cost function. 
    
    grad : array_like
        A vector of shape (n, ) which is the gradient of the cost
        function with respect to theta, at the current values of theta.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta. You should set J to the cost.
    Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
    derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta
    
    Hint 1
    ------
    The computation of the cost function and gradients can be efficiently
    vectorized. For example, consider the computation
    
        sigmoid(X * theta)
    
    Each row of the resulting matrix will contain the value of the prediction
    for that example. You can make use of this to vectorize the cost function
    and gradient computations. 
    
    Hint 2
    ------
     When computing the gradient of the regularized cost function, there are
    many possible vectorized solutions, but one solution looks like:
    
        grad = (unregularized gradient for logistic regression)
        temp = theta 
        temp[0] = 0   # because we don't add anything for j = 0
        grad = grad + YOUR_CODE_HERE (using the temp variable)
    
    Hint 3
    ------
    We have provided the implementatation of the sigmoid function within 
    the file `utils.py`. At the start of the notebook, we imported this file
    as a module. Thus to access the sigmoid function within that file, you can
    do the following: `utils.sigmoid(z)`.

def oneVsAll(X, y, num_labels, lambda_):

    Trains num_labels logistic regression classifiers and returns
    each of these classifiers in a matrix all_theta, where the i-th
    row of all_theta corresponds to the classifier for label i.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like
        The input dataset of shape (m x n). m is the number of 
        data points, and n is the number of features. Note that we 
        do not assume that the intercept term (or bias) is in X, however
        we provide the code below to add the bias term to X. 
    
    y : array_like
        The data labels. A vector of shape (m, ).
    
    num_labels : int
        Number of possible labels.
    
    lambda_ : float
        The logistic regularization parameter.
    
    Returns
    -------
    all_theta : array_like
        The trained parameters for logistic regression for each class.
        This is a matrix of shape (K x n+1) where K is number of classes
        (ie. `numlabels`) and n is number of features without the bias.
    
    Instructions
    ------------
    You should complete the following code to train `num_labels`
    logistic regression classifiers with regularization parameter `lambda_`. 
    
    Hint
    ----
    You can use y == c to obtain a vector of 1's and 0's that tell you
    whether the ground truth is true/false for this class.
    
    Note
    ----
    For this assignment, we recommend using `scipy.optimize.minimize(method='CG')`
    to optimize the cost function. It is okay to use a for-loop 
    (`for c in range(num_labels):`) to loop over the different classes.
