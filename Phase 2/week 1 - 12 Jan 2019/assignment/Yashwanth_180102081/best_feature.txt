As seen from the graph F1vsF2 the label 1 and 2 data points can be easily seperated by
a line or curve or boundary.
Also the scatter plot of the above has label 1 and 2 points seperately and it can be distinguished.
Also by comparing all other graph nothing other than this was able to distinguish the labels.
Hence, the features 1 and 2 was able to distinguish the labels correctly.
