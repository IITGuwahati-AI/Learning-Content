## To be done for next week

1. Complete All Video Lectures and Quizes of week8 of the [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

2. Complete the ipython notebook for both [exercise7](https://github.com/IITGuwahati-AI/Learning-Content/blob/master/Phase%202/week%207%20-%2025%20March%202019/Exercise7/exercise7.ipynb) provided(nothing is optional and the points for each part is mentioned in the notebook).

3. You can find a nice explanation of K-means Clustering [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-6a6e67336aa1). This [video](https://youtu.be/4b5d3muPQmA) explains k-means in a layman term. 

4. sentdex has very nice explanation of k-means in python. You can find his videos [here](https://youtu.be/HRoeYblYhkg) on youtube.

5. Add your python(if you are doing by your own) or jupyter notebook files and create pull request.

6. Each part of the assignment has equal weightage - total 100 points.

7. Complete assignment in octave(for the sake of your certification, it is optional and does not consist of any point).

8. Please try to submit the ipynb instead of python file so that we can check the result directly. You can use magic tool like `%matplotlib inline` in order to plot the graph directly in the notebook.

9. For PCA have a look at the first week repository and the posts related to week on facebook group.
