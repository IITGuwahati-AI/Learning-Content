## To be done for next week

1. Complete All Video Lectures and Quizes of week9 of the [Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

2. Complete the ipython notebook for both [exercise8](https://github.com/IITGuwahati-AI/Learning-Content/tree/master/Phase%202/week%208%20-%2001%20April%202019) provided(nothing is optional and the points for each part is mentioned in the notebook).

3. You can find a nice explanation of both the topics [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-basics-part-4-anomaly-detection-recommender-systems-and-scaling-b8bbf0413aa9). This [video](https://youtu.be/12Xq9OLdQwQ) by microsoft research on youtube might be helpful as well. 

4. For more detailed explanation on anomaly detection you can have a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbNiD76yE8o&list=PL8Bgdi87Y1lWJtBDuStNuEGoXKVFmMrF3) playlist on youtube. 

5. Add your python(if you are doing by your own) or jupyter notebook files and create pull request.

6. Each part of the assignment has equal weightage - total 100 points.

7. Complete assignment in octave(for the sake of your certification, it is optional and does not consist of any point).

9. you can download the complete file of this week assignment from this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilrcFrM5ORaLEgYhFgdb9mpjTtwdYrOG).
