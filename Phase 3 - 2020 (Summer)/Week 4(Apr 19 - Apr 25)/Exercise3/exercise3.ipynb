Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools.

We use the `.mat` format here because this is the dataset provided in the MATLAB version of this assignment.

    "= B[:, 1:3] will replaces the columns with index 3 to 5 of A with the columns with index 1 to 3 from B. To select columns (or rows) until the end of the matrix, you can leave the right hand side of the colon blank. For example, A[:, 2:] will only return elements from the $3^{rd}$ to last columns of $A$. If you leave the left hand size of the colon blank, you will select elements from the beginning of the matrix. For example, A[:, :2] selects the first two columns, and is equivalent to A[:, 0:2]. In addition, you can use negative indices to index arrays from the end. Thus, A[:, :-1] selects all columns of A except the last column, and A[:, -5:] selects the $5^{th}$ column from the end to the last column. Thus, you could use this together with the sum and power ($^{**}$) operations to compute the sum of only the elements you are interested in (e.g., `np.sum(z[1:]**2)`). In the starter code, `lrCostFunction`, we have also provided hints on yet another possible method computing the regularized gradient.\n",
