The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server.

After that, you will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions.\n",

The objective of collaborative filtering is to predict movie ratings for the movies that users have not yet rated, that is, the entries with $R(i, j) = 0$. This will allow us to recommend the movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.\n",
