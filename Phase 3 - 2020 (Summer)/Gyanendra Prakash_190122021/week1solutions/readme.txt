This contains the week 1 assignment of the summer 2020 AI course of iitg.ai club. The objective was to import data sets from 
a text file into a matrix using numpy and plot features vs each other (2 at a time).
This is a collection of 45 (10C2 plots..) image files corresponding to the plots of 2 features vs each other at a time.
I used only jupyter notebook to produce the output, and redirected the output to a html page, and using an extension for chrome,
downloaded all the 45 files using a single click.
#Bonus question's sol was updated too.
