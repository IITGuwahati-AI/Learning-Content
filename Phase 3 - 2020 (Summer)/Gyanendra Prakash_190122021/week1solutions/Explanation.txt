data sets were imported into matrix using gentext function.

The two features which classify the two labels perfectly were feature 1 and feature 2, cause their plots caused least overlapping between the two labels.
Bonus question's answer: 
# PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of given labels, such that least number of features can help distinguish between given labels.
[0.19550175 0.17821025 0.1740652  0.10549293 0.10017266 0.09534421
 0.07929688 0.04445225 0.02060953 0.00685434]
this was the variance of each feature that came as the output. Feature 1 and feature 2 have it maximum, so as observed these are the best features classifying the labels.
