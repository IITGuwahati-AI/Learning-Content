# Instructions

(Google for terms that you can't understand)

1. Import the dataset into a matrix using **numpy**. The dataset is space delimited with first column as labels and rest 10 as features.

2. Plot all features vs each other (2 at a time) using **matplotlib** - `red` for label `1` and `blue` for label `2`, clearly denote the axes and the title of the plot along with proper markings (what does each axis represent) on the axes.

3. Find the **two features** which can classify the **two labels** perfectly.

4. *Optional* (with *bonus* points, see below): Use scikit-learn to apply [Principal Component Analysis(PCA) (Theory)](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~rshamir/abdbm/pres/17/PCA.pdf), [(Reference Code)](https://towardsdatascience.com/pca-using-python-scikit-learn-e653f8989e60) find the best two features and check if they are the same as the ones you observed. 

# Point System

- 10 points for completing the 1st 3 instructions each (Total points = 30).
- The bonus task weighs *50 points*.
- The toppers of the *leaderboard* will be given prizes.
