Part 1 :

we can see from the plot that Feature 1 And 2 classify the labels best 




Bonus : 



   from the pca code we can see that the vaiance for feature 1 and 2 is equivalent to that of the best feature when we reduce the dimensions to 2

also the plot by the best features is same almost same as feature 1vs 2
