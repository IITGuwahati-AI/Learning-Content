1.After comparing all the the bifeature graphs , on the basis of observation I have concluded that Feature 1 vs Feature 2 graph depicts 
the labels in the best possible way as the two labels are nearly divided into 2 regions of concentric circles(1st quadrant only) centered
at origin with radii 4 and 8 respectively
2.PCA analysis
Again feature pair 1,2 comes out to be the best pair as it distinguishes the labels in the best way . This conclusion has been arrived at in 2 ways
a. In the first code block , the variance ratios have been compared after PCA reductionof feature pairs as well as feature pairs with labels
-From the analysis it is concluded that features 3 and 8 retain the largest variance ratio when PCA-reduced from 2-d to 1-D
That means that this feature pair is the most alike and hence redundant i.e. one feature can be expressed in the other's form  
But when combined with the labels: 1,2 retains the highest variance ratio which means that it ,this pair, can depict the labels in the best possible way
b.In the second code snippet the 1D reduced graphs of each pairs vs labels has been analysed at feature 1,2 pair comes out be the best pair again ,by observation
From the analysis its clear from the figures that feature 1 and 2 pair distinguishes the labels most appropriately
The second best pair seems to be 2,10 which matches with the first analysis made above {91.99 for feature 2,10 pair and 92.11 for 1,2 pair}
