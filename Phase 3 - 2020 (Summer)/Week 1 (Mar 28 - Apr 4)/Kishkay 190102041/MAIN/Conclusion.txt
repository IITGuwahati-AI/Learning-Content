Feature 1 vs 2 is the best way to differentiate between the two labels.
This is because there is a definite simple curve that divides the two region taken by the two labels.
Given a new set of features of some new label, the label can be determined by solely plotting its feature 1 vs 2.
Same can be said for the graphs from PCA as the graphs obtained for feature 1 vs 2 after applying PCA can also distinguish label 1 vs label 2 very easily
