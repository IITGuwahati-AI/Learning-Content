    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools. You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the README file in the [github repository](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)."

    "Concretely, to determine the training error and cross validation error for $i$ examples, you should first randomly select $i$ examples from the training set and $i$ examples from the cross validation set. You will then learn the parameters $\\theta$ using the randomly chosen training set and evaluate the parameters $\\theta$ on the randomly chosen training set and cross validation set. The above steps should then be repeated multiple times (say 50) and the averaged error should be used to determine the training error and cross validation error for $i$ examples.\n",

    "For this optional (ungraded) exercise, you should implement the above strategy for computing the learning curves. For reference, the figure below  shows the learning curve we obtained for polynomial regression with $\\lambda = 0.01$. Your figure may differ slightly due to the random selection of examples.\n",
