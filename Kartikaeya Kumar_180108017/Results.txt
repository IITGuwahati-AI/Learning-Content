The best plot(classifying the two labels perfectly) was obtained in the plot of Feature 1 and Feature 2. The two features were observed to be distinct in this plot.They were observed to form concentric quarter circles.

Moreover, significant plots were observed between Features 5,9 and Features 7,9.
Here the Two features were not observed to be distinct, rather they were observed to form a broad wave like band.

Rest all other combinations of features returned with a random plot.
