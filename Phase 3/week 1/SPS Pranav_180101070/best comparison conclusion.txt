By observing all graphs i.e each feature vs other we can conclude that Feature 1 vs Feature 2 
graphs gives a easier distinction between Label 1 and label 2 beacuse the points are scattered well enough that they can
be seperated by a curve and also other comparisons had blue and red points coincide at some place which makes drawing a curve 
difficult.Hence we can conclude that Feature 1 vs Feature 2 is the best possible comparison.
